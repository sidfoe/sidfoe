### âœ¨ Hello there and Welcome âœ¨ 

My name is Sydney and I am a Gameplay/UI Programmer with about 2-3 years of experience. I've worked on projects like NBA 2K23, NBA 2K24, and NBA Clash with a variety of experience in console, pc and mobile development. I graduated in 2021 from Bradley University, with a major in Game Design and minors in Computer Science and History. I am passionate about game development, and love to learn about all the ways to create games. I am currently looking for full-time work in the game industry.
